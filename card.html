		<h1>Thank You Letter</h1>
		<p>Dear [classmate girl's name],</p>
		<p>As the school year comes to a close, I wanted to take a moment to write to you and express some things that have been on my mind. Firstly, I want to say that I deeply regret not having talked to you or considered you as a friend throughout the year. It was never your fault, and I realize now that I missed out on getting to know a kind and friendly person.</p>

		<p>I also want to apologize for not checking up on you when you were affected by dengue. It was wrong of me to assume that you would be okay and not offer any help or support. I understand that it must have been a difficult time for you, and I should have been more considerate.</p>

		<p>Furthermore, I must confess that I am a shy and nervous person and have never had a way with girls. This may have been one reason why I never approached you or tried to strike up a conversation. However, I appreciate your kindness and friendly demeanor towards me. Your compliment on my project meant a lot to me, and I thank you for that.</p>

		<p>As we say goodbye to school, I want to wish you all the best in your future endeavors. I hope that you go on to achieve great things and lead a happy and fulfilling life. If there's one thing I've learned from this experience, it's that we should always be kind and considerate towards others, even if we don't know them well.</p>
		<p>Even though I know that I cannot give this letter to you in person, I want you to know that writing this has been a cathartic experience for me. I will keep this letter as a reminder of the lessons I have learned, and as a memory of you as a kind and friendly person.</p>

		<P>I regret not having the courage to speak to you and get to know you better, but I hope that someday I will be able to overcome my shyness and become a better person. For now, I want to thank you for being a positive influence in my life, even if it was in a small way.</P>

		<p>I wish you all the best in your future, and I hope that our paths will cross again someday.</p>
